## things done
- I've completed the integration of Zustand and TanStack Query.

Zustand: Now manages the user authentication state globally across the app.
TanStack Query: Now handles data fetching for products and categories, providing automatic caching and smoother UI transitions.
Refactored Pages: Home, Shop, Product Detail, Login, and Signup pages have all been updated to use these new tools for better performance and reactivity. You can see the full details in the walkthrough.
